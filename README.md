# self-driving-car-nanodegree
This repository contains both the notes, the challenges and the big projects that I have done during my Udacity self-driving car nanodegree.


## Structure

The repository is divided in 3 main sub-folders. Each of them corresponding to one of the nanodegree parts. The **first part** of the course contains formation about Computer Vision, Deep Leaerning and sensor fusion (Kalman filters, EKFs, geometry, etc.). The **second part** focuses on localization, path planning, control and system integration. The last part are **extracurricular materials** (interviews, etc.).

The two main folders are subdivided by modules. All the lessons related to each of the projects that the course involves is considered a *module*. These are the modules of the two main program parts:

- Part 1: Computer Vision, Deep Learning and sensor fusion
  - Lane lines finding: Color filters, region of interest, Canny edge detection and Hough transformation
  - Advanced lane lines finding
  - Traffic sign classifier
  - Behavior cloning
  - Extended Kalman Filter
  
-Part 2: Localization, path planning, control and system integration
  - Kidnapped vehicle: Markov and general localization, motion models and particle filters
  - Online presence: LinkedIn and GitHub improvement
  - Highway driving: Path planning and behavior prediction
  - PID control
  - Real vehicle: Self-driving cars architecture and ROS nodes and packages

Inside each module folder there is a *project* subfolder containing all the files related to the project of the module.
