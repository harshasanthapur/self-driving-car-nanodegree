# Overview of NanoDegree program

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

There are two main approaches (both of them will be studied during the ND):
- Robotics-based: Fuse sensors outputs to measure environment and decide how to act.
- DL-based: Learn to drive given (usually human-generated) examples.

There are several modules that end with a project. The easiest ones can last 1 week while the hard ones can take up to a month. I will recive human feedback on my deliverables.
